# AndroidAppChallenge

Thanks for giving me apportunity for trying this interview test!!

### Difficulties
I think I failed hard on [Dagger2](https://google.github.io/dagger/)
as I'm still trying to find a way of how to use it.
The app crashes all the time T.T.

[RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) is also a very new
library to me, barely able to use it but apparently I kinda like it.

First time for me to use [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room)
this much (before this just a try to use it). With code completions,
I think I'm going to look into it deeper. I'm a trying my best for fullstack anyway.

Android Studio MVP architecture. I am taking the challenge to do this
with MVP as for me I'm using the libraries that I'm not familiar with
might as well try it out! :D

Let's see what's next... oh!!! UI testing!!!

##### UI Testing
Seriously, I have never thought that I'm going to do this.
Never thought about that since my current company have our own QA
that prepared most the testing automation.

#### Thanks

Though I dont think I did well for this test, I would like to
thank Mr. Abed Elaziz Shehadeh for giving me the opportunity to take the test.
I know I did bad, but, experience is the best teacher.

**P/s:** I kinda need help on Dagger2 if you don't mind showing me how to use it.
